# Master Of Puppets

Master of Puppets is a simple and fast modular autorig for Maya.  

It originally made for Project Borealis' production needs but is meant to be fit any pipeline and can be customized heavily by:

1. Creating your own modules.

2. Writing scripts that will be called by the autorig at key moments (pre/post build, pre/post publish, etc.).

Building a full biped body rig currently takes between 1 and 5 seconds, depending on whether you have your node editor opened or not... :)

That being said, this tool is still a work in progress and I wouldn't recommend using it for production yet.

Thanks to Project Nayuki for the color space conversion algorithms!
